# sql-challenge
# Background
For this SQL challenge I created 6 tables to hold data from 6 CSV files containing employment data for a fictional company from the 1980s and 1990s.
I created tables using SQL which can be viewed in the sql-challenge-table_schema file.
My data analysis can be viewed in the sql-challenge-data_analysis
I created an ERD visual using Quick DBD.
